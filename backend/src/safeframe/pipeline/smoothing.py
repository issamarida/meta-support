"""Temporal smoothing of tracks so blur never flickers off.

Detectors miss people for a frame or two (motion blur, partial occlusion),
and trackers report a track only on frames where it was matched. For a privacy
tool every missed frame is a leak, so we:

1. linearly interpolate boxes across short gaps inside a track, and
2. pad each track a few frames before its first and after its last detection.
